Sequtus 2 is a rewrite of the first Sequtus project. There are a lot of things
I could have done better in the first Sequtus and I want to fix them here. I
then intend to go further and add networking support. From there I'm not sure
where I will go.

I do plan to have a massive improvement to the testing functionality, as I
convert things from the old sequtus into the new model I'm trying to add
tests where I can.

In an effort to avoid having to make lots of terrain graphics I'm setting this
one in space.

I've also merged the improvements made in Downstream into Sequtus2 (such as
fullscreen support).
