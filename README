Sequtus 2 is a rewrite of the first Sequtus project. There are a lot of things
I could have done better in the first Sequtus and I want to fix them here. I
then intend to go further and add networking support. From there I'm not sure
where I will go.

In an effort to avoid having to make lots of terrain graphics I'm setting this
one in space.

I'm also back-porting several things from Downstream too.
